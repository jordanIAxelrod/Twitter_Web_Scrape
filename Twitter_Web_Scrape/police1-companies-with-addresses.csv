The BODY ARMOR VENT I.C.E. RFK is a paradigm shifting invention because, for the first time in the history of body armor, there is now continuous air flow between the plate carrier and the wet base layer, creating evaporative cooling. The RFK consists of two flexible, extremely lightweight, scientifically sculpted, fabric/foam panels which can easily be worn under all existing body armor. The air flow chimneys and horizontally punched holes throughout the panels allow air to flow south to north and circumferentially. The system is completely passive with the energy coming from the human diaphragm muscle. It dramatically amplifies and maintains continuous evaporative cooling: reducing heat stress, epidermal issues, and lowering physical discomfort by spreading out the weight load of body armor.","Body Armor Vent

Cellsense detects all cell phones even if they are switched off or concealed in a body cavity. Cell phones are increasingly manufactured with reduced metal content, making detection using conventional metal detectors less certain.

Most defensive tactics systems are either in effective or too complex for the officer to retain which leads to failure. These failures have cost millions of dollars in lawsuits, fractured public trust, the loss of credibility in the court system, serious injuries and death to both the public and the peace officers who serve their communities on a daily basis.
Law enforcement, military, and security professionals are in need NOW more than ever of a complete tactical system that covers de-escalating conflict, mental and physical preparation, nutrition, and physical tactics.
Complete Tactical Consultants was formed by a group of elite level professional combat athletes, coaches, law enforcement, veteran military, and licensed medical doctors to create The Tactical Athlete Program, a complete tactical system.

FRONTLINE has five distinct platforms that give Police Departments and Dispatch Centers a way to make their job’s a lot easier. We focused on simplifying and customizing each of our products to help our clients, citizens and community organizers stay in tune with each other.

Our goal is to simplify the means of collecting and disseminating information in a secure online environment. Technology is ever changing, and it is hard for individual communities to keep up with the pace. Today, some information is still being collected by paper and pen or at best added into an excel file and stored on someone’s desktop. FRONTLINE Public Safety Solutions will change the way data management works within a variety of government agencies.
The five platforms include our Tool-Kit to manage things such as vacation watches, track at risk residents, track criminal trespass orders, directed patrols and 8 other modules.  We have Training software to track mandates, certificates, send out training notices and multiple reports to give you training hours in seconds.  Quality Assurance software for Dispatch centers and Body Worn Camera audit software with a RMS system to track early warning alerts and reports and lastly out Professional Standards software to track compliments, complaints, internal affairs investigations, and awards.","FRONTLINE Public Safety Solutions

Aware, built by first responders for first responders, supports your mission of saving lives, minimizing property loss and protecting first responders.
Aware is:
• Cost-Effective
• Easy to Deploy
• Mobile
• Scalable
• User-Friendly
• CAD System Neutral
• Secure
Aware is a suite of technologies that, when combined, build a robust common operating picture for any type of incident response and for special events. Aware cuts radio clutter by offering real-time transcription of radio talk groups, reducing the need for repeated communication. Everyone with access and associated with the incident can see the radio transmission and read it – on any device (MDT, tablet, computer and cell phone).
Location is key! Aware gives you the exact location of any unit responding to the scene. Units responding, using our patented smartphone application, can provide photos and videos of the scene as they are arriving. This mapping feature can be viewed on any device.
We worked with leading Air Force Scientists to build our ground-breaking communication and radio transcription technology. Our team then integrated this communication technology with commercially developed mapping and imaging products and our patented smartphone application to present a comprehensive incident command and management solution – AWARE by GlobalFlyte.","GlobalFlyte, Inc.

      The 2018 International Association of Women Police Conference will focus on the policing world and how we can all lead change in our communities and workplaces.

The chosen theme, “leading change”, was selected to highlight the importance of issues currently impacting police organizations. Everyday changes occurring as a result of technology, social dynamics, as well as the economy and crime issues will all be featured throughout the conference.
This conference will benefit your police organization, as a whole, as well as the development of each delegate. We are very excited to host this event. It is an excellent opportunity, not only for the Calgary Police Service but police agencies around the world, to join our community and enhance women in law enforcement. We look forward to seeing you August 23 - 26 in Calgary!

Back then LAPD officers noticed that many of the individuals arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) had very low or zero alcohol concentrations. The officers reasonably suspected that the arrestees were under the influence of drugs, but lacked the knowledge and skills to support their suspicions. In response, two LAPD sergeants collaborated with various medical doctors, research psychologists and other medical professionals to develop a simple, standardized procedure for recognizing drug influence and impairment. Their efforts culminated in the development of a multi-step protocol and the first DRE program. The LAPD formally recognized the program in 1979.","International Drug Evaluation & Classification Program

For the past five years Orange Photonics instrumentation has been used in mission-critical work by local, state and federal law enforcement organizations, departments of agriculture analytical laboratories, and universities, in addition to licensed commercial business operations. Orange Photonics’ technology helps support safety and compliance amid the expansion of cannabis legalization.
Headquartered in New Hampshire, Orange Photonics’ team members come from diverse industries including spectroscopy sciences, health care, standards organizations, and educational institutions. We harness our expertise in support of the customers we serve.
Our roots are in spectroscopy, which is the science of using light to measure chemical composition. Our legacy goes back three generations of spectroscopists to include one of the founders of PittCon, often honored as the “Father of Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy”, Paul Wilks.
Spectroscopy and liquid chromatography, two analytical methods used in Orange Photonics’ cannabis potency testing equipment, are commonly used in pharmaceuticals, environmental testing, and food manufacturing. University of Kentucky (UK) Division of Regulatory Services’ Hemp Proficiency Program indicates that Orange Photonics technology performs with a level of accuracy on par with laboratory based analytical instrumentation.","Orange Photonics

Whether you’re a supplier looking to stock the world’s most comprehensive line of safety and signaling products … or a first responder seeking information on how emergency signaling devices save lives… you’ve come to the right place! We’ve been making flares for nearly a century and all of our flare products are made in the USA under the strictest quality and safety guidelines. When used in conjunction with light bars, Orion flares increase your safety zone by incrementally (i) reducing the speed of passing traffic an additional 5.1% and (ii) causing an additional 5.3% of passing traffic to change lanes (95.7% of vehicles and 98% of trucks change lanes). Safer, easier to use and store, and better for the environment, Orion flares eliminate potassium perchlorate, which means no chemical contaminants left on the roadside after burning out. The easy-light cap has no loose red phosphorous, which minimizes sparking and splatter and these eco-friendly flares are safer to store since there is no flaking red phosphorous in the boxes.

ShotStop plates weigh about 66% less than similarly sized ceramic plates and about 80% less than similarly sized steel plates. Importantly, ShotStop plates stand up to multiple hits without losing their integrity or effectiveness. ShotStop’s patented Duritium® polymer is poised to replace most ballistic plates in common use today for high-powered rifle protection because it is lighter in weight, thinner in profile and not as fragile as ceramic technologies at same protection levels.

PoliceOne independently tested these plates and reported the results HERE.

Capewell also offers lightweight plate carriers and a wide variety of safety and tactical gear for law enforcement, military and homeland security markets. See our full line of products and services at www.capewell.com.","ShotStop distributed by Capewell Aerial Systems LLC

Mike Farrell, President and Founder of Smart Firearms, is an Airline Pilot with an extensive background in pilot training and human factors. In 2003, he was trained as a Federal Flight Deck Officer, a program borne out of the events of 9/11. As impressed as Mike was with quality of the world class law enforcement instructors he was dismayed by the low quality of the training equipment being used. Plastic guns with no working triggers, simulator weapons which did not properly fit or snap into duty holsters were just 2 of a laundry list of issues Mike observed. In an environment where failure could lead to thousands of lives lost and worldwide political implications, the use of cheap substandard training gear which leaves potentially fatal training scars just didn’t make sense. After inventing duty weapons to fit the Glock and S&W M&P retention holsters and going into service with the largest police agencies in to world, Smart Firearms continued its innovation. It now carries CEW weapon which fits the X2 retention holster, an M4 Patrol Rifle trainer and will introduce in January an advanced trainer which will fit the SIG320 holster. Smart Firearms is constantly improving it’s weapons and in it’s R&D listens to the people who matter, Firearms and Defensive Tactics instructors. They are who they work for.","Smart Firearms Training Devices

  It  is designed for any shooter who needs or desires to become a confident and  thereby competent situational firearms user.   That’s TARGABOT’S purpose—to build muscle memory skills for swift and  effective use when things begin moving unpredictably out there.   Unlike static targets, real threats don’t  stand still.
Our end-user  community would naturally be trainers within law enforcement, armed forces, and  self-defense communities, but would also embrace shooters who, for whatever  reason, want more challenging and engaging target shooting experiences that  could potentially pay dividends in an increasingly volatile environment.

Our approach is simple. We listen closely to officers in the field, then design and build tactical communication accessories specifically for their needs. Every officer knows, a radio is only as good as what it’s connected to.

The status quo is obsolete
Earphone Connection introduced the first wireless microphone with push-to-talk, the first quick release cables and many other ground breaking products to redefine the status quo. No one likes to settle for mediocre.

The right equipment can save lives
Situational awareness is critical for police in a dangerous encounter. An earpiece allows officers to hear communications clearly and prevent bad guys from hearing what could turn the situation against them. Earphone Connection offers new comprehensive solutions that improve comfort, safety and efficiency in 2018.

It has expanded to many cities throughout the state with plans to launch in areas all across the country in 2019. 
We started this company by connecting with various non-profits, families, caregivers and first responders throughout Minnesota. We learned about the challenges that parents and caregivers of individuals with special needs and various conditions face, and decided to work on solutions to solve some of their biggest challenges and concerns, one being the ability for individuals to communicate effectively when in times of crisis or escalation. When talking to first responders, we learned that their biggest concern was the lack of accessible and timely information during critical moments. Our solution is to use technology to bridge this gap of communication to both first responders and individuals in times of crisis.","The Vitals App
